# Cursor Rule: Documentation

btl.run uses organized, focused documentation with clear separation between living guides and historical snapshots.

## Documentation Structure

## Rules

### 1. Root Directory - Essential Reference Docs

**Only these belong in root:**
- ✅ README.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, SETUP.md (essential references)
- ✅ INTEGRATION.md, DEPLOYMENT-CHECKLIST.md, STATUS.md (setup docs)
- ✅ Claude.md (AI context)
- ✅ CHANGELOG.md (version history when releasing)
- ✅ Standard files (.gitignore, package.json, etc.)

**NEVER create in root:**
- ❌ `SESSION_SUMMARY.md`
- ❌ `COMPLETION_NOTES.md`
- ❌ `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`
- ❌ Any other status/summary files

### 2. Living Guides - `docs/guides/`

**Purpose:** Current, maintained how-to documentation

**Create here when:**
- Documenting how to use a feature
- Writing detailed operational procedures
- Creating onboarding materials
- Explaining complex workflows

**Examples:**
- `docs/guides/testing-workflow.md`
- `docs/guides/game-mechanics-explained.md`
- `docs/guides/debugging-techniques.md`

**Maintenance:**
- Keep these updated as system evolves
- Delete when obsolete
- Consolidate overlapping guides

### 3. Historical Notes - `docs/history/`

**Purpose:** Dated snapshots of major sessions and decisions

**Create here when:**
- Completing a major implementation phase
- Making significant architectural decisions
- Finishing a milestone
- Documenting complex problem-solving

**Format:**
- Filename: `YYYY-MM-DD-description.md`
- Length: 100-300 lines (concise)
- Style: Bullet points, not paragraphs
- Content: Decisions and outcomes, not code walkthrough

**Important:**
- These are historical snapshots - never update after creation
- Check `docs/history/README.md` - update existing if same day/topic
- Add entry to timeline in `docs/history/README.md`

### 4. Technical Lessons - `.cursor/_lessons_learned/`

**Purpose:** Capture debugging solutions to prevent repeated mistakes

**Create here when:**
- Solving a non-obvious problem
- Documenting a recurring issue
- Capturing a technical best practice

**Categories:** aws/, typescript/, frontend/, api/, zod/, general/

## Documentation Quality

### Be Concise
- Essential information only
- No verbose play-by-play
- Link to code/commits, don't duplicate them

### Be Accurate
- Update docs when system changes
- Remove obsolete information
- Keep file paths current

### Be Organized
- Information in the right file
- Don't duplicate across files
- Clear section headings

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Creating Session Summaries

```markdown
# DO NOT CREATE:
SESSION_SUMMARY_2026-01-30.md
WORK_COMPLETED_TODAY.md
CHANGES_MADE.md
```

**Instead**: Update existing documentation files (SETUP.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, etc.)

### ❌ Redundant Information

```markdown
# DO NOT duplicate information across files
README.md         → "Here's how to deploy..."
DEPLOYMENT.md     → "Here's how to deploy..." (same info)
SETUP.md          → "Here's how to deploy..." (same info again)
```

**Instead**: One source of truth (SETUP.md for deployment)

### ❌ Obsolete Content

```markdown
# DO NOT keep outdated information
"Deploy with: pnpm deploy"  ← Wrong (we use PowerShell scripts)
"Deploy with: npm run deploy" ← Wrong (we use PowerShell scripts)
```

**Instead**: Update immediately when changes occur

## Checklist Before Creating New File

## Checklist Before Creating New Doc

Before creating ANY new .md file:

- [ ] Does this belong in an existing root doc? (README, SETUP, ARCHITECTURE, etc.)
- [ ] If it's a how-to, should it go in `docs/guides/`?
- [ ] If it's historical, should it go in `docs/history/YYYY-MM-DD-name.md`?
- [ ] If it's a technical lesson, should it go in `.cursor/_lessons_learned/`?
- [ ] Am I duplicating existing information?
- [ ] Will I maintain this or will it become stale?

**When in doubt:** Update an existing file instead of creating a new one.

## btl.run Documentation Philosophy

- **Organized hierarchy** - Root (essential), docs/guides/ (how-to), docs/history/ (dated snapshots)
- **Living documents** - Root docs and guides stay current
- **Historical snapshots** - docs/history/ captures major milestones (never updated)
- **Technical lessons** - `.cursor/_lessons_learned/` for debugging patterns
- **One source of truth** - Each topic has ONE authoritative file
- **Dated history** - All historical notes include YYYY-MM-DD in filename
- **No session summaries in root** - Use docs/history/ instead
