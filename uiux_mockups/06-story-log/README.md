# Screen 06: Story Log

A dual-view history of the game: an immersive AI-generated narrative and a structured event log.

## Purpose

- **Catch Up**: Players joining late or returning can read the full story.
- **Immersion**: Presents the game as a cohesive narrative, not just turns.
- **Reference**: Structured log for verifying specific mechanics/events.

## Key Elements

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Tabs** | Switch between "Narrative" (Prose) and "Events" (Log). |
| **Narrative View** | Scrollable, novel-style text generated by the AI GM. |
| **Events View** | Chronological list of turn outcomes, combat, and discoveries. |

## Navigation

- **Back**: Returns to the previous context (Waiting Room or Game Turn).

## Viewing
