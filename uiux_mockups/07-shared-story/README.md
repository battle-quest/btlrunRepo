# Screen 07: Shared Story

A viral entry point for new users. This screen is what people see when they click a shared story link from a friend.

## Purpose

- **Showcase**: Display the cool AI narrative generated from a friend's game.
- **Convert**: Provide a low-friction "Start Your Story" button to get them playing immediately.

## Key Elements

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Story Card** | The full narrative text + player name + outcome. |
| **Viral CTA** | "Start Your Story" button anchored at the bottom. |

## Navigation

- **Start Your Story**: Goes to `00-start-screen` (or `01-tribute-setup` depending on desired friction).

## Viewing

pnpm dev:pwa
